Every industry in today’s day and age generates an unprecedented amount of data, it has become increasingly imperative to obtain “Information” from the data. With the growing amount of data in recent years, most of which is unstructured, it’s difficult to obtain the relevant and desired information. One technique used to mine through the data and fetch the information that we are looking for is Topic Modelling. Topic Models are very useful for the purpose for document clustering, organizing large blocks of textual data, information retrieval from unstructured text and feature selection. There exist different methodologies of building text models, such as, LDA, LDA with Gibbs sampling, and Correlated Topic Modelling. I've implemented Anchor Free Correlated Topic modelling.
