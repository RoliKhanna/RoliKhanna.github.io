Hi there! I'm Roli, and I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University. I've been doing user research on eXplainable AI systems under the DARPA-XAI program for the last two years. I'm right at home with topics lying at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human computer interaction.

### What do I do?

I make AI systems explainable.

I love working with the process of making such systems from scratch: right from coding them, building their models, to explaining why they behaved the way they did.

My interests vary from Reinforcement learning to Information Visualization.

Anything that involves deep research and analysis of the "whats" and "whys" and the "how might we fix this" gets me up and running. I love solving problems, and I love it even more when people benefit from it.
On a regular day, I like sketching out daily life in comics. On a not-so-regular-day, I like to curl around with a cup of steaming chai and read Harry Potter. Also, extra points for rain!

### How did I get here?

TLDR;
Learnt Artificial intelligence in my undergrad, and loved it -- Started working as a machine learning engineer in a video analytics startup -- Applied to graduate school because knowledge gap -- Started graduate school at Oregon State University -- Learnt Inclusive Design and Human Computer Interaction, and loved it more -- Started working as Graduate Research Assistant doing what I love!
