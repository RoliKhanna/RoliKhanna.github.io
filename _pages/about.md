Hi there! I'm Roli, and I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Oregon State University. I've been doing user research on eXplainable AI systems under the DARPA-XAI program for the last two years. I'm right at home with topics lying at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human computer interaction.

*What do I do?*

I make AI systems explainable.

I love working with the process of making such systems from scratch: right from coding them, building their models, to explaining why they behaved the way they did.

My interests vary from Reinforcement learning to Information Visualization.

*How did I get here?*

TLDR;
Learnt Artificial intelligence in my undergrad, and loved it -- Started working as a machine learning engineer in a video analytics startup -- Applied to graduate school because knowledge gap -- Started graduate school at Oregon State University -- Learnt Inclusive Design and Human Computer Interaction, and loved it more -- Started working as Graduate Research Assistant doing what I love!


*What makes me roll?*

Anything that involves deep research and analysis of the "whats" and "whys" and the "how might we fix this" gets me up and running. I love solving problems, and I love it even more when people benefit from it.
On a regular day, I like sketching out daily life in comics. On a not-so-regular-day, I like to curl around with a cup of steaming chai and read Harry Potter. Also, extra points for rain!
