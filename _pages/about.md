Hi there! I'm Roli, a graduate student at Oregon State University.

I make AI systems explainable.

I love working with the process of making such systems from scratch: right from coding them, building their models, to explaining why they behaved the way they did.

My interests vary from Reinforcement learning to information visualization.
