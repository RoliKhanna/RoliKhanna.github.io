title: "Counterfactual state explanations for reinforcement learning agents via generative deep learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/counterfactual/
excerpt: 'Counterfactual explanations, which deal with “why not?” scenarios, can provide insightful explanations to an AI agent's behavior. In this work, we focus on generating counterfactual explanations for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents which operate in visual input environments like Atari. We then evaluate the effectiveness of counterfactual states on human participants who are not machine learning experts. Our results indicate that counterfactual state explanations have sufficient fidelity to the actual game images to enable non-experts to more effectively identify a flawed RL agent compared to the (nearest neighbor) baseline and to having no explanation at all.'
